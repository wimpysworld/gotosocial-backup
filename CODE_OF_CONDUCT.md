# Code of Conduct

This document is currently a stub.

In lieu of a fuller code of conduct, here are a few ground rules.

1. We are not interested in input from right-wingers, nazis, fascists, transphobes, homophobes, racists, harassers, abusers, white-supremacists, misogynists or capitalists. This list is NOT exhaustive. Input includes PRs, issues, and any other communication. Be gone!
2. We will not accept changes (code or otherwise) created with the aid of "AI" tooling. "AI" models are trained at the expense of underpaid workers filtering inputs of abhorrent content, and does not respect the owners of input content. Ethically, it sucks.
3. We will not accept changes (code or otherwise) that move GoToSocial toward enterprise / surveillance / other toxic capitalist pursuits.
4. We will not accept changes (code or otherwise) that encourage toxic behaviour on social media. This is obviously subject to debate, as humanity as a whole is still figuring out how to safely engage in social media.
5. No spam!
